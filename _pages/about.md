This site is a personal blog of Alpha Argon (not a name; argon for short; can be uncapitalized). The blog is about design, coding, or some random stuff. You may think the design of this site is kinda weird and nostalgic, like Windows 98, which is intentional as I like it.

Most of the content is in Chinese, as it is my native language. Words in other languages, like Japanese, are also *appear-able*. English is used in the page chrome[^chrome] for better typography, while loading Han fonts can be way too costly. Feel free to ask for a translation if you are interested in a specific post. You may also ask for a translation of this about page, as long as you are interested.

There should be an email under this domain right here, but not yet set up. You may contact me through other social media from the icons in the sidebar (if you can see it) or the footer (if you can see it, too).

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Custom theme is used. Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/alphaArgon/alphaArgon.github.io).

[^chrome]: Like “chrome” in “browser chrome” — not the browser Google Chrome. It’s a term for the UI parts other than the main content area.
